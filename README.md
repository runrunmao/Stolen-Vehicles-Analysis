## Project Overview

This project analyzes vehicle theft data to uncover critical insights into patterns regarding the **timing**, **locations**, and **vehicle characteristics** associated with theft incidents. By examining temporal, vehicular, and geographic factors, the analysis identifies **high-risk scenarios** and proposes **actionable preventive measures**.

## Objectives

- **Temporal Trends:** Identify when vehicles are most frequently stolen by examining **yearly, monthly, and weekly patterns**.
- **Vehicle Analysis:** Determine **high-risk vehicles** based on **type, age, and color**.
- **Geographical Insights:** Identify **regions with higher risks** and explore the correlation with **population density**.

## Methodology

### Data Extraction & Cleaning
- Queried and aggregated vehicle theft records using **SQL**.
- **Cleaned and formatted** datasets in **Excel** for accurate analysis.

### Temporal Analysis
- Evaluated **theft rate trends** by **year, month, and day of the week**.
- Created **bar charts** visualizing daily theft frequencies.

### Vehicle Characteristics Analysis
- Identified the **most frequently stolen vehicle types**.
- Analyzed **vehicle age** to determine vulnerability.
- Compared theft risk between **luxury vs. standard vehicles**.
- Developed **heatmaps** for theft occurrences by **vehicle color**.

### Geospatial Analysis
- **Mapped theft occurrences** using Excel's geographic mapping features.
- Investigated correlations between theft incidents, **population size, and density**.
- Created **scatter plots** illustrating relationships between **population density and theft frequency**.

## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Theft Trends Over Time
- Theft incidents peak on **Mondays and Tuesdays**, declining throughout the week.
- Lowest theft rates on **Saturdays**, slightly rising on **Sundays**.

### 2. High-Risk Vehicle Types and Colors
- **Station wagons, saloons, and hatchbacks** are most commonly stolen.
- **Silver and white vehicles** are primary theft targets, followed by black and blue.
- **Trailers** show disproportionately high theft rates, notably silver-colored trailers due to commercial usage.
- **Older vehicles** experience higher theft rates, potentially lacking modern anti-theft features.

### 3. Geographic Distribution of Vehicle Thefts
- **Auckland** has the highest theft incidence, followed by other densely populated areas.
- Lower-density regions have significantly fewer theft occurrences.
- Strong correlation between theft rates and **urban population density**.

### 4. Population Density vs. Vehicle Theft
- **High-density regions** like **Auckland and Wellington** report the most theft incidents.
- Lower-density regions (**Otago and Southland**) show fewer vehicle thefts.
- Vehicle theft is predominantly an urban issue, particularly where vehicles are parked publicly.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides stakeholders—including **law enforcement agencies, vehicle owners, and insurers**—with valuable, data-driven strategies for theft prevention. By clearly identifying **high-risk times, locations, and vehicle characteristics**, targeted preventive measures can significantly enhance **vehicle security**.
